# Apps United — Android

## Quick start
1. Open this folder in Android Studio (`mobile/android`).
2. In `MainActivity.kt`, set `LAUNCHER_URL` to your live site (Netlify/GitHub Pages).
3. Plug in your Android phone with USB debugging enabled.
4. Run ▶️

## UX
- First tab opens your launcher.
- Clicking partner links (especially `target="_blank"`) opens a new tab.
- Tabs keep their state; switch without reloads.
- App bar menu: Back / Forward / Share / Open in Chrome.

## Build for testing
- Use a debug build on device.
- For Play Console later, generate a **signing key** and keep it safe.
